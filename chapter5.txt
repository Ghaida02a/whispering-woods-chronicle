With her heart thumping to the beat of distant thunder, Elara stood in front of the enormous obsidian doors.  Sensing the Cipher concealed beneath her cloak, the runes engraved into the stone pulsed gently in response to her presence.  Now she was too far gone to go back.

 She touched her palm to the symbol in the middle with a shaking hand.  The air glistened.  The passage hummed softly, and the doors opened and closed with the groaning of old bones.

 The sanctum inside resisted time.  The flames of floating candles were locked in a constant sway as they flared in slow motion.  Books floated in midair, pages flipping without any physical contact.  In the middle, an hourglass defied gravity by dripping sand upward.
The Chronomancer sat at the far end, dressed in garments made of darkness and starlight.

 He said, "You have the Cipher," without raising his gaze.  His voice was layered, as if it were echoing from the past and the future.

 "I need to know," Elara murmured as she moved forward, "about how to break the loop."  Yesterday, my city was caught in the middle.  My brother is merely a memory.

 The Chronomancer's eyes rose.The lifetimes he had witnessed were reflected in his eyes, one silver and one gold.  "Every response has a price.  Are you willing to make the payment?

 Elara paused.  Time warped around her, revealing shards of what could have been: a world free from conflict, a world in which her brother lived, a world untroubled by tragedy.

 She tightened her grip on the Cipher.  "I am."

 The sanctum started to fall apart as the Chronomancer grinned.
