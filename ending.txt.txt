Elara reached at the ancient Moonroot Tree, guided by the map’s final symbol. With Shadow by her side, she placed the wooden charm into the hollow knot in the bark. Light streamed through the canopy as the forest stirred—whispers rising into joyful voices. The curse was lifted, and warmth swept through the woods, with flowers blooming where shadows once lingered. When Elara returned to her village, she was no longer seen as reckless, but as the girl who had healed the forest. From that day forward, the woods sang songs of peace to those who listened with wonder.
