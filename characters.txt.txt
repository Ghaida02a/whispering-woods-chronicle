Elara is a young villager with tangled auburn hair and sharp green eyes. Brave and endlessly curious, she often explores the edges of the ancient woods despite the warnings. Her discovery of a moss-covered scroll will change everything.

Elara has known Shadow, a dark-coated wolf with piercing silver eyes, since she was a small child. He keeps a silent watch over her, ever aware of dangers in the forest. He is devoted to her and frequently picks up on her emotions before she does.


Master Thorne is a grumpy but wise old librarian. He guards ancient scrolls and knows secrets even the Chronomancer fears. Though curt and hard to please, his knowledge is unmatched. He holds a key that unlocks a long-forgotten spellbook central to Elaraâ€™s quest.
