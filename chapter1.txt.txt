The Whispering Woods Chronicle

Elara discovered a scroll wrapped in dust and moss, hidden beneath a creaky floorboard that had moaned for years beneath her grandmother's rocking chair, beneath a home softened by ivy and time. Age had almost absorbed the ink, which shimmered weakly with symbols that were not visible to the naked eye. Something stirred beyond the hills, where the Whispering Woods whispered secrets to the wind. The trees could communicate, the locals had always claimed, but only to those who paid close attention. The stories had never been credible to Elara. Not until her name was uttered by the scroll. And not until she proceeded in the direction of the forest, where destiny awaited her beneath the roots and shadows moved like memories.
