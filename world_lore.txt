Ancient Runes:
The Ancient Runes are a forgotten language etched into the stones of time itself. Only Chronomancers can decipher their shifting meanings, which change depending on the hour and lunar phase. These runes power the time gates and are essential to manipulating time safely.

Mythical Creatures:
The Griffin guards the Sky Peaks, its feathers glinting with stardust. It’s a majestic blend of eagle and lion, feared and revered. Only those who pass its silent judgment may enter the Temple of Winds, where the Chronomancer’s secrets lie buried in clouds.
